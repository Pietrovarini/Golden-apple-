Reactor for unlimited energy that WILL WORK


Model of the Unlimited Energy Generator - Electromagnetic Toroidal Reactor

1. Basic Concept

The central idea is to use an electromagnetic field inside a toroidal reactor to generate energy, exploiting the properties of the field itself. The energy introduced into the system through an initial electrical source creates a self-sustaining and potentially amplifiable electromagnetic field, thanks to the toroidal shape, which traps and circulates magnetic fluxes.

2. Structure of the Toroidal Reactor

The reactor has a toroidal geometry, which is known to be optimal for the creation and containment of electromagnetic fields. The magnetic field created inside can circulate with minimal dispersion, reducing energy losses and maintaining high efficiency.

Materials for the Toroid:

Special ferromagnetic metals (e.g., iron-nickel-cobalt alloys) known for their electromagnetic properties, allowing maximum conservation and amplification of the magnetic field.

Superconductors: If kept at low temperatures, superconductors can further reduce energy losses within the system.



3. Generation of the Electromagnetic Field

The initial electrical energy is introduced into the system through coils positioned along the perimeter of the toroid. These coils are designed to create a magnetic field that sustains itself, thanks to the shape of the reactor, which minimizes flux losses.

Coil Characteristics:

High-efficiency coils made with superconducting materials to reduce resistance and losses.

Strategically placed around the toroid to maximize the creation of a uniform and stable magnetic field.



4. Field Amplification

Once the electromagnetic field is initiated, the toroidal geometry allows the field to amplify by trapping magnetic fluxes and reducing external losses. This principle could allow the extraction of more energy than initially introduced, thanks to internal electromagnetic resonance phenomena.

Amplification: The toroidal effect, combined with materials of high magnetic permeability, allows for energy self-sufficiency and potentially unlimited energy generation.


5. Extracting Energy from the System

To extract energy, electromagnetic sensors and collectors can be used to convert the magnetic flux into usable electric current. These collectors must be designed to operate without interfering with the self-sustaining magnetic flux.
