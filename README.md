Reactor for unlimited energy that WILL WORK


Model of the Unlimited Energy Generator - Electromagnetic Toroidal Reactor

1. Basic Concept

The central idea is to use an electromagnetic field inside a toroidal reactor to generate energy, exploiting the properties of the field itself. The energy introduced into the system through an initial electrical source creates a self-sustaining and potentially amplifiable electromagnetic field, thanks to the toroidal shape, which traps and circulates magnetic fluxes.

2. Structure of the Toroidal Reactor

The reactor has a toroidal geometry, which is known to be optimal for the creation and containment of electromagnetic fields. The magnetic field created inside can circulate with minimal dispersion, reducing energy losses and maintaining high efficiency.

Materials for the Toroid:

Special ferromagnetic metals (e.g., iron-nickel-cobalt alloys) known for their electromagnetic properties, allowing maximum conservation and amplification of the magnetic field.

Superconductors: If kept at low temperatures, superconductors can further reduce energy losses within the system.



3. Generation of the Electromagnetic Field

The initial electrical energy is introduced into the system through coils positioned along the perimeter of the toroid. These coils are designed to create a magnetic field that sustains itself, thanks to the shape of the reactor, which minimizes flux losses.

Coil Characteristics:

High-efficiency coils made with superconducting materials to reduce resistance and losses.

Strategically placed around the toroid to maximize the creation of a uniform and stable magnetic field.



4. Field Amplification

Once the electromagnetic field is initiated, the toroidal geometry allows the field to amplify by trapping magnetic fluxes and reducing external losses. This principle could allow the extraction of more energy than initially introduced, thanks to internal electromagnetic resonance phenomena.

Amplification: The toroidal effect, combined with materials of high magnetic permeability, allows for energy self-sufficiency and potentially unlimited energy generation.


5. Extracting Energy from the System

To extract energy, electromagnetic sensors and collectors can be used to convert the magnetic flux into usable electric current. These collectors must be designed to operate without interfering with the self-sustaining magnetic flux.

This toroidal reactor represents an innovative approach to generating energy by harnessing self-sustaining electromagnetic fields. Toroidal geometry is well known for its ability to contain and amplify magnetic fluxes, reducing energy dispersion and increasing the overall efficiency of the system. The reactor can be powered by an initial electrical source, which creates a circulating electromagnetic field within the toroid.

The materials used for the toroid structure and the coils placed around its perimeter are selected to optimize the creation and stability of the magnetic field, reducing energy losses and allowing effective management of the magnetic flux.

Use of high-efficiency electromagnetic materials to reduce losses.

Creation of a self-sustaining field with potential electromagnetic amplification.


This technology offers a new pathway for energy generation, based on well-established and tested principles in magnetic field science.

Second Part: Full Model (Crucial Information)

In the second part of the project, the true innovation comes into play: the amplification of the electromagnetic field thanks to the toroidal shape and the use of superconducting or ferromagnetic materials with high permeability. The arrangement of the coils and the internal electromagnetic resonance allow the system to potentially extract more energy than was introduced, making it self-sustaining.

Additionally, the structure of the system allows for energy collection from the generated magnetic field through specially designed collectors, which convert the electromagnetic energy into electric current without interfering with the field's stability.

Advanced Key Points:

Electromagnetic amplification effects thanks to the internal resonance of the toroid.

Optimized energy extractors that do not interfere with the self-sustaining field.

Potential for unlimited energy generation in an optimal theoretical context.
